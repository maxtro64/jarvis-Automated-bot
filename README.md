# Jarvis AI Assistant

Jarvis is a voice-activated personal assistant that can perform tasks such as browsing the web, playing music, reading the latest news, and interacting with an AI model to provide helpful responses. This project uses Python and integrates various libraries and APIs to enhance its functionality.

## Features

- **Voice Commands**: Recognizes and processes user commands using `speech_recognition`.
- **Web Browsing**: Opens websites like Google, YouTube, and Facebook.
- **Music Playback**: Plays songs from a predefined library.
- **News Updates**: Fetches the latest news headlines using a news API.
- **AI Chat**: Interacts with an AI model to answer user queries.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts AI-generated or predefined responses to speech using `gTTS` and `pygame`.

## Technologies Used

### Libraries
- **speech_recognition**: For capturing and processing voice input.
- **webbrowser**: To open web pages directly from commands.
- **pyttsx3**: For basic text-to-speech functionality.
- **gTTS**: For generating high-quality speech output.
- **pygame**: To play audio files.
- **requests**: To fetch data from APIs.

### APIs
- **NewsAPI**: Provides real-time news headlines.
- **OpenAI**: Powers AI-based conversational responses.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
1. Install Python (3.7 or later).
2. Install the required Python libraries.

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis-ai-assistant.git
   cd jarvis-ai-assistant
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Add your API keys in the code:
   - Replace `"yourapikey"` with your OpenAI API key.
   - Replace the NewsAPI key in the code (`apiKey="your_newsapi_key"`).

---

## Usage

1. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Use voice commands to interact with Jarvis.

### Example Commands
- **"Jarvis, open Google."**
- **"Play [song name]."**
- **"What's the latest news?"**
- **"Who are you?"**

## How It Works

### Workflow
1. **Voice Input**: Captures user voice commands using `speech_recognition`.
2. **Command Processing**:
   - Specific keywords trigger predefined tasks (e.g., "open Google").
   - Other queries are sent to the AI model for processing.
3. **Response**:
   - Predefined tasks execute directly.
   - AI-generated responses are spoken back using `gTTS` and `pygame`.

### AI Interaction
- The AI model processes general queries or complex tasks.
- The response is contextually relevant and human-like.
